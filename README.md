# Work Day Scheduler
This app required me to create functionality for saving tasks to a local work day calendar.

## App Breakdown
The calendar consists of several rows that indicate standard working hours. Each row has a time label, a text area for typing in tasks, and a save button. The rows are color coded depending on if they are in the past, present, or future compared to the current hour. The app checks the current time every 15 seconds and updates the row colors as needed. When a task is typed into the text area and the save button is clicked, that task is saved in local storage and is loaded again when the page refreshes.
